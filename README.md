First assignment in Open source energy system modeling.

The repository consists of:

    - quadratures.py contains two functions, 'midpoint(a, b, f)' and 'trapezoidal(a, b, f)', which approximate the integral of a function f in the interval [a,b].
    
    - test_quadratures.py contain a test function for each function in quadratures.py.
